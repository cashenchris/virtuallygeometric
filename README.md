This code is for testing whether a multiword in a free group is virtually geometric. Towards this end it implements various algorithms related to elements and subgroups of finitely generated free groups, including computing the JSJ decomposition of a free group relative to a multiword. 

Requires python 2.7 and the packages 'pexpect' and 'networkx<=1.9.1'. API changes in networkx1.10 break things. If you have a newer version of networkx then you must run this program in a virtual environment with networkx<=1.9.1 installed.

All of the geometricity and virtual geometricity code requires the program 'heegaard', which is available at [http://www.math.uic.edu/t3m/](http://www.math.uic.edu/t3m/). You must also edit the file ./geometric/heegaard.py and fill in the path to the heegaard binary.


Examples of testing virtual geometricity from the command line:

```
#!bash
$ ./vg.py a aabAAAB
True
$ ./vg.py aabbccacb
False
```

Test if things are working correctly by running python2 and doing the following, which takes several known examples, twists them by a random automorphism of the free group, and then checks that the program still gives the expected answer.
```
>>> import freegroups.whiteheadgraph.test.virtuallygeometric as test
>>> test.testall(randomautomorphismlength=10)
Found expected virtual geometricity in all examples.
```
